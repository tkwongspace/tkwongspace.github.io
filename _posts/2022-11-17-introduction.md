Hi! My name is Zijian Huang, and you may call me Charles or TK (first letters of the two characters in my name in Cantonese). 
I am currently a PhD student in Sun Yat-sen University (in Guangzhou, Guangdong, PRC) 
and focusing on environmental responses among mangrove species. 
During my past PhD years I earned many different skills in coding (mainly R, Python, and a bit C++, Java & IDE), 
statistical modelling (mainly time series analysis), 
and experiences in operating machines that are used in field observations and sampling,
including Terrestrial Laser Scanner (FARO X330), UAV (DJI Matrices Series), 
as well as LAI-2000 (for measuring Leaf Area Index) and GFS-3000 (for measuring Photosynthesis).

I am so glad that you visit here. But sorry for the website is still under construction.
It's my first time to create a personal page with Github Pages and Jekyll, 
and so many thanks to all associated engineers 
and [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul) who created this fantastic theme [Millennial](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).

If you have any question and suggestions, please feel free to [connect with me](mailto: charles.hzijian+mypage@gmail.com).
And please stay in tune and come back for a visit in the future!
